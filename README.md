## As a coding bootcamp student, 
I want to take a timed quiz on Javascript fundamentals that stores high scores so that I can guage my progress compared to my peers.

Working on this challenge will prepare me for upcoming interviews where it's likely that I'll be asked to complete a coding assessment.
